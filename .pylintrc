[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
disable=format,invalid-name,spelling,fixme

[REPORTS]

# Python expression which should return a note less than 10 (10 is the highest
# note). You have access to the variables errors warning, statement which
# respectively contain the number of errors / warnings messages and the total
# number of statements analyzed. This is used by the global evaluation report
# (RP0004).
evaluation=10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)

# Template used to display messages. This is a python new-style format string
# used to format the message information. See doc for all details.
#msg-template=

# Set the output format. Available formats are text, parseable, colorized, json
# and msvs (visual studio). You can also give a reporter class, e.g.
# mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.
output-format=text

# Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages.
reports=no
